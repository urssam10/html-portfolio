    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Samar, a passionate B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering
      at Manipal University Jaipur. I'm currently honing my skills in web
      development and exploring various aspects of computer science. I have a
      strong interest in building user-friendly and efficient websites, and I am
      always eager to learn and apply new technologies.
    </p>

      Besides my academic pursuits, I'm interested in sports like cricket and
      enhancing my knowledge through courses like Web Development BootCamp by
      Angela Yu. I believe in continuous growth, and I aim to blend my technical
      skills with problem-solving abilities to create impactful projects. When
      I'm not coding, you can find me watching movies or series, as I'm an avid
      fan and love sharing my reviews and thoughts on them.
